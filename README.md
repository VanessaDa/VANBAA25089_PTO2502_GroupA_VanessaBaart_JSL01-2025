# Kanban Board | Launch Career

A pixel-perfect, fully responsive Kanban board built with semantic HTML and CSS to exactly replicate a provided Figma design. This static web application features a sidebar, multiple task columns, and task cards styled to match a professional UI brief.

> ðŸ“„ **JSL01 Challenge:** This project was completed as part of the **JSL01 Front-End Development Challenge**, with the goal of transforming a Figma layout into a functional and responsive Kanban board using only HTML and CSS.

## ðŸŽ¨ Figma Design Reference

All styles, layout, spacing, and responsive behavior are based on the official Figma file:

[ðŸ”— Figma Design â€“ JSL01 Challenge](https://www.figma.com/design/y7bFCUYL5ZHfPeojACBXg2/Challenge-1-%7C-JSL?node-id=0-1&t=yngAIXXKnJfH7Jj3-1)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Kanban board includes:

- A static sidebar with logo, board title, and active board button
- Three task columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**
- Task cards featuring custom emojis and shadow styling
- A responsive layout that adapts cleanly to desktop and mobile screens
- Exact alignment, colors, and typography as specified in Figma

## âœ… Key Features

- âœ… **Favicon and page title** for branding consistency
- âœ… **Exact visual match** to Figma design using HTML and CSS
- âœ… **Fully responsive layout** using Flexbox and media queries
